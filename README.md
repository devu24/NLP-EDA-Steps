 NLP-EDA-Steps

To clean and preprocess text data in Pandas for NLP tasks, hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide based on the methods commonly used:

 1. Loading the Data
   - Step: Load the text data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Explanation: The first step is to import the necessary libraries and load your dataset into a DataFrame.
   - Code:
     ```python
     import pandas as pd
     df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')
     ```

 2. Lowercasing
   - Step: Convert all text to lowercase.
   - Explanation: Text data may contain words in different cases, and converting them to lowercase ensures uniformity.
   - Code:
     ```python
     df['text'] = df['text'].str.lower()
     ```

 3. Removing Punctuation
   - Step: Remove punctuation marks from the text.
   - Explanation: Punctuation can be removed as it generally does not add significant value to NLP tasks.
   - Code:
     ```python
     import string
     df['text'] = df['text'].str.replace(f"[{string.punctuation}]", "", regex=True)
     ```

 4. Tokenization
   - Step: Tokenize the text.
   - Explanation: Tokenization involves splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
   - Code:
     ```python
     df['tokens'] = df['text'].str.split()
     ```

 5. Removing Stopwords
   - Step: Remove stopwords from the tokens.
   - Explanation: Stopwords like 'the', 'and', 'is' are common words that do not add much meaning to text data and can be removed to reduce noise.
   - Code:
     ```python
     import nltk
     from nltk.corpus import stopwords

     nltk.download('stopwords')
     stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))

     df['tokens'] = df['tokens'].apply(lambda x: [word for word in x if word not in stop_words])
     ```

 6. Stemming/Lemmatization
   - Step: Apply stemming or lemmatization to reduce words to their base form.
   - Explanation: Stemming reduces words to their root form (e.g., 'running' -> 'run'). Lemmatization is a more sophisticated approach, considering the context and returning valid words.
   - Code (Lemmatization):
     ```python
     from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer
     nltk.download('wordnet')
     
     lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
     df['tokens'] = df['tokens'].apply(lambda x: [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in x])
     ```

 7. Rejoining Tokens
   - Step: Rejoin tokens into a cleaned text.
   - Explanation: After preprocessing, you may want to reassemble the tokens back into a single string for further analysis.
   - Code:
     ```python
     df['cleaned_text'] = df['tokens'].apply(lambda x: ' '.join(x))
     ```

 8. Saving the Cleaned Data
   - Step: Save the cleaned data.
   - Explanation: Store the cleaned data for later use in your NLP models.
   - Code:
     ```python
     df.to_csv('cleaned_data.csv', index=False)
     ```

 Additional Steps:
   - Handling Special Characters: Remove or replace special characters.
   - Removing Numbers: Optionally, you may want to remove numbers from the text.
